            <p>I think there are many, I am certainly one of them, who revere sacred buildings, historic in the long life of this country, and simultaneously are ecstatic at hearing such beauty in a place of worship .It is this combination which has made Music in Country Churches create a unique form of concert which holds in the memory a mixture of purity of sound, reverence for the expertise of soloists or singers or chamber groups or orchestras, and a true sense of spirituality.</p>
            <p>It is hard, perhaps it is not right, to select beauty from the memory.  Mstislav Rostropovich and unearthly sounds which seemed to come without the least efforts; of groups, the English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Raymond Leppard or Sir Colin Davis; of soloist Dame Kiri Te Kanawa or Maria João Pires or Murray Perahia – but I find that once I start this I do not stop.  I shall certainly refrain from a competition about beauty in churches.</p>

            <p>Music in Country Churches is a celebration of beautiful music and beautiful churches. I was fortunate to be present at the first concert more than twenty years ago in Norfolk. Since then, like thousands of people in many areas, I have enjoyed concerts and recitals by musicians and choirs of international repute.</p>
            <p>Cathedrals and large parish churches have always been traditional venues for concerts, but it was an innovation to use country churches for this purpose. It has proved to be an outstanding success in many rural areas from East Anglia to the West of England. The concerts have become increasingly popular, and for a large number of families, like my own, annual visits to one or more concerts have become  regular fixtures in our diary.</p>
            <p>Apart from the financial benefit for rural churches, Music in Country Churches has also led to a new appreciation of the ways in which our glorious heritage of church buildings can be used. Listening to great music in the relative intimacy of a country church is an unforgettable experience, and to have been associated with this initiative has been a privilege and a joy.</p>

            <p>My association with Music in Country Churches began over fifteen years ago.  Since then I have travelled many miles to concerts that combine the attractions of historic architecture and the talents of first class international artists.</p>
            <p>Living in the North West of England always means a journey down the dreaded M6 and beyond to get to concerts in the South West or East Anglia, but I have never regretted making the pilgrimage south.  I’ve rubbed shoulders with Lang Lang, Sergei Krylov, Emma Kirkby, Rostropovich and Murray Perahia to name but a few, so what do a few hours in a car matter when the reward is a concert in beautiful surroundings performed by world famous and hugely talented musicians?</p>
            <p>Of course an added attraction is the ever-present marquee – usually to be found in the grounds of the rectory – dispensing delicious suppers, or simply cheese straws and wine - a perfect way to begin or end the evening.</p>
            <p>I have brought many friends to concerts and they have always enjoyed the relaxed and friendly atmosphere coupled with a first rate musical experience in wonderful surroundings.</p>
            <p>The hard-working and dedicated team behind Music in Country Churches provide us, their supporters, with a series of concerts year-in, year-out that never fail to entertain and inspire their grateful audiences.</p>
            <p>Long may it continue.</p>

            <p>Being the helm of Pol Roger enables me to meet a lot of different people, attend very many diverse events and discover impressive and beautiful places all over the world. But one thing which I enjoy above anything else is attending a <em>Music in Country Churches</em> concert.</p>
            <p>My wife and I have been coming at least once a year in July for the past ten years and it is always a great pleasure to share an evening with all those involved in the running of this charity.</p>
            <p>We have not only discovered so many lovely churches and their surrounding villages and countryside but have listened to some of the greatest artists. We shall never forget Maria João Pires, Maxim Vengerov, Lang Lang and of course, the English Chamber Orchestra: great moments of pure beauty and intense emotion. And all this for a good cause!</p>

            <p>It has always been a great pleasure for me to take part in the Music for Country Churches concerts, whether it was with orchestra, chamber music or a solo recital.  The churches in which the concerts take place are always special, frequently situated in the most lovely English countryside, and the audiences are always warm, attentive and most welcoming.  Meeting with the audience in a marquee where supper is served after the concert is another touch enjoyed by all the performers and audience alike.</p>
            <p>I sincerely hope to be able to take part in future concerts and would like to give my thanks and support to all those who make these concerts possible.</p>

            <p>The King's Consort has been performing concerts for Music in Country Churches for fifteen years: we have played in some of the finest churches in England, often in hidden jewels, off the beaten track of "regular" concert venues. MICC's audiences are knowledgeable, unstuffy and enthusiastic, the programming and artists always world class, and the dinners afterwards great social occasions. The icing on the cake is to know that HRH Prince Charles gives the organisation his strong support. Britain's country churches are such a central part of our heritage, and to hear and see them filled with fine music cannot be bettered. Long may MICC thrive!</p>

            <p>As a former manager of the English Chamber Orchestra (ECO) I have over the last 20 years attended many concerts promoted by ‘Music in Country Churches’, an excellent charity working hard to raise money for hard-up rural churches. Each concert is meticulously organised and features guest artists of international calibre. Due to the limited size of the venues the charity is not obliged to engage soloists on the basis of their selling power alone, or resort to overtly popular (or over-played) repertoire in the hope of attracting an audience of thousands, hence artistic excellence is always of primary importance and audiences are often treated to a relatively unknown (but always very attractive) piece played alongside some of the great classics. For the ECO, performing at a ‘Music in Country Churches’ concert was always a special occasion. Ticket prices are very reasonable – so please do come along and enjoy a relaxed evening of great music in one of our lovely rural churches!</p>
