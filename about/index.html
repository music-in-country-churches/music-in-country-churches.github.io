          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>Now in its 30th year, Music in Country Churches was set up as a charitable trust in 1989 with the active support of the Prince of Wales, who has attended over 50 of our concerts.</p>
          <h2>
            <a name='aims'>Aims</a>
          </h2>
          <p>We have two aims – to take concerts by artists, ensembles and orchestras of international renown to country churches of special beauty and historical importance and raise funds whereby the Trust can make significant donations to the churches we visit, to help specifically with the heavy costs of the upkeep of the fabrics.</p>
          <p>Concerts have been given by such distinguished musicians as Rostropovich, Cecilia Bartoli, Murray Perahia, Maria João Pires, Lang Lang and Maxim Vengerov (for further see <a href='/artists'>Artists Page</a>).</p>
          <p>At the end of 2017 the Trust has arranged 82 weekends of music in nine counties, and has made donations to the churches totalling £572,000.  Our concerts are normally at weekends, on Friday and Saturday evenings, or on a Tuesday and Wednesday, sometimes with a morning concert on the second day.  Since 2005 the Trust has returned to some of the larger churches already visited and, through the generosity of the incumbents and PCCs in providing the local infrastructure, have been able to help smaller churches within their benefices.</p>
          <p>Another feature of these weekends is the marquee where members of the audience can have supper before or after concerts, and drinks during the interval.</p>
          <h3>Fundraising Events</h3>
          <p>Every three or four years, we need to undertake a major fundraising event, and these have been held at: The Middle Temple Hall, St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle, Spencer House, Eton College Chapel, The Banqueting House, Whitehall, and Fishmongers' Hall, London Bridge.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Having attended so many of the Trust’s concerts, I have had the opportunity to see and share in the enormous pleasure given by outstanding performances of great works in some of our finest churches and in areas where music of such a standard is rarely or never available.</p>
              <p>It is one of the Trust’s unique achievements that it has been able to take music of this quality to the countryside and at the same time make significant contributions to over seventy churches to help with the costs of their upkeep.</p>

          <h3>Friends</h3>
          <p>The Friends are our core body of support.  A minimum annual donation of fifteen pounds is required to become a Friend.  Friends receive one or two newsletters a year, preliminary details about each of the three weekends, and a two-week period of priority booking.  The names of those making an annual donation of £50 or more a year will be printed on all our future concert programmes.  To become a Friend, please write to our PO Box No. address (see <a href='/contact#enquiries'>Contact Us</a>).</p>
          <h3>Sponsors and Big Donors</h3>
          <p>We are fortunate in having some loyal supporters without whose help we would not be able to maintain the standard of the concerts or the level of our donations. If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, please write to our PO Box Address (see <a href='/contact#enquiries'>Contact Us</a>).</p>
