            <h2>The English Chamber Orchestra</h2>
            <img src='/images/artists/english-chamber-orchestra.jpg'>
            <p>The English Chamber Orchestra is the most recorded chamber orchestra in the world, its discography containing 860 recordings of over 1,500 works by more than 400 composers.</p>
            <p>The ECO has also performed in more countries than any other orchestra, and played with many of the world’s greatest musicians. The American radio network CPRN has selected ECO as one of the world’s greatest ‘living’ orchestras. The illustrious history of the orchestra features many major musical figures. Benjamin Britten was the orchestra’s first Patron and a significant musical influence. The ECO’s long relationship with such great musicians as Slava Rostropovich, Pinchas Zukerman, and earlier with Daniel Barenboim led to an acclaimed complete cycle of Mozart piano concertos as live performances and recordings, followed later by two further recordings of the complete cycle, with Murray Perahia and Mitsuko Uchida.</p>
            <div class='extended-bio'>
              <p>Recent tours have included the USA, Bermuda, China, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Slovenia and Austria (culminating in a concert at Vienna’s Musikverein) as well as concerts across the UK and at London’s Royal Festival Hall, Royal Albert Hall, Cadogan Hall, and Kings Place.</p>
              <p>The Orchestra has been chosen to record many successful film soundtracks including Dario Marianelli’s prizewinning scores for Atonement and Pride and Prejudice, and several James Bond soundtracks, and has taken part in a variety of other film and television projects.</p>

            <h2>Škampa String Quartet</h2>
            <img src='/images/artists/skampa-string-quartet.jpg'>
            <p>Helena Jiříkovská - violin</p>
            <p>Adéla Štajnochrová - violin</p>
            <p>Radim Sedmidubský - viola</p>
            <p>Lukáš Polák - violoncello</p>
            <p>The Škampa Quartet is among the very finest of an outstanding group of current Czech string quartets that has represented their country in major Concert Halls around the world for twenty five years.</p>
            <div class='extended-bio'>
              <p>Through their mentors, the legendary Smetana Quartet, they trace their roots to the earliest quartets - such as the Bohemian Quartet - in a land described in the 18th century as the Conservatoire of Europe and that remains, to this day, the very cradle of European Chamber Music.</p>
              <p>To this innate musicality they have added their own particular research to inform their understanding of the folk-song and poetry, rhythms and dance from which their native music grew - to the extent that their recordings of the quartets by Janacek and Smetana particularly are quoted as the bench-marks against which other performances are judged.  This research resulted in, among other things, the production of an illustrated talk - 'Janacek and his Moravian Roots' - and led to collaboration with singer Iva Bittova which successfully crossed many musical boundaries.</p>
              <p>Prizes at International Competitions, Awards from the Royal Philharmonic Society and others - and appointment as the first-ever Resident Artists at Wigmore Hall - marked the solidity of their early years and provided recognition which led to invitations to perform at major Festivals world-wide including Prague Spring, Schwetzingen, Edinburgh, Schleswig-Holstein and Melbourne.  These engagements included collaboration with many fine internationally recognised artists including Melvyn Tan, Itamar Golan, Josef Suk, Michael Collins, Kathryn Stott and Janine Jansen among many others.</p>
              <p>From the beginning they have established a close relationship with BBC Radio 3 resulting in regular broadcasts from Wigmore Hall, St John's Smith Square, LSO St Luke's and the Chamber Music Proms.</p>
              <p>The Škampa quartet have been award-winning recording artist for Supraphon for most of the Quartet's career.  They are now also among the elite artists whose performances have been selected for release on the Wigmore Hall Live label.  Education has long been an important facet of their work, and one that they find particularly rewarding.  They teach in many places around the world but particularly at the Royal Academy of Music in London where they were appointed Visiting Professors of Chamber Music in 2001.</p>

            <h2>Nash Ensemble</h2>
            <img src='/images/artists/nash-ensemble.jpg'>
            <p>The Nash Ensemble, Resident Chamber Ensemble at Wigmore Hall since 2010, is acclaimed for its adventurous programming and virtuoso performances. It presents works from Haydn to the avant-garde, and is a major contributor towards the recognition and promotion of contemporary composers: by the end of the 2016/17 season the group will have premièred over 300 new works, of which well over 200 have been specially commissioned from 225 different composers.</p>
            <div class='extended-bio'>
              <p>An impressive collection of recordings illustrates the same varied and colourful combination of classical masterpieces, little-known neglected gems and important contemporary works. Releases receiving critical acclaim include all the Mozart String Quintets, Russian chamber music, chamber works by Schumann and Joaquin Turina, and chamber works by Czech composers incarcerated in the Theresienstadt concentration camp between 1941 and 1945. Recent releases include a CD of Hollywood composers for Hyperion, Harrison Birtwistle's The Moth Requiem for Signum Classics and a chamber music CD of works by Max Bruch for Hyperion. In June the Nash will record works by Ernst von Dohnányi and there are plans for a recording of chamber works by Julian Anderson for NMC.</p>
              <p>In its 2016/17 series at Wigmore Hall the Nash Ensemble combined the music of Vienna, from the 'Viennese Classical school' of Haydn and Mozart to Mahler and the 'second Viennese school' of Schoenberg and his pupils, with music from Hungary and the Czech lands. Continuing the ongoing and fruitful collaboration between the Ensemble and the Royal Academy of Music, there was a special concert in February in which members of the Nash and students from the RAM combined 'Side by Side', to perform rarely heard early works by Schoenberg, Webern and Berg.</p>
              <p>The main theme for the 2017/18 Wigmore Series is 'The French Connection', juxtaposing music from Stravinsky's French period with music by Saint-Saëns, Fauré, Debussy, Ravel, Poulenc and Milhaud. The Ensemble's annual selection of the best of British contemporary music - Nash Inventions on 20th September - includes Alexander Goehr's latest chamber work (a Wigmore Hall commission for the Ensemble), Harrison Birtwistle's single movement Trio, Peter Maxwell Davies's acclaimed String Quintet, and another new Nash commission - a Quintet for clarinet and strings by John Casken.</p>
              <p>Recent highlights have included concerts in Turkey, France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy as well as a tour of the USA. The Ensemble broadcasts regularly for the BBC including appearances at the BBC Proms.</p>
              <p>The Nash Ensemble has won numerous accolades including The Edinburgh Festival Critics award 'for general artistic excellence' and two Royal Philharmonic Society awards in the chamber music category "for the breadth of its taste and its immaculate performance of a wide range of music."</p>
